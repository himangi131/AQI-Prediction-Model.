# 🌫 AQI Prediction Model

A Machine Learning project that predicts the **Air Quality Index (AQI)** based on pollutant concentrations and weather parameters.  
Built in **Google Colab**, but fully compatible with **Jupyter Notebook** and any Python-supported platform.  
The dataset is sourced from **Kaggle**.

## 📖 Overview
Air quality is an important factor affecting health and the environment.  
This project uses historical air quality data to train a predictive model that can determine AQI values and classify them into categories such as:
- 🟢 Good
- 🟡 Satisfactory
- 🟠 Moderate
- 🔴 Poor
- 🟤 Very Poor
- ⚫ Severe

The model is easy to use — you just input pollutant and weather parameters, and it outputs the AQI value along with its category.

## 🏗️ Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection** – Kaggle dataset containing pollutant levels and weather conditions.
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Cleaning missing values, handling outliers, and formatting data.
3. **Feature Selection** – Choosing relevant pollutant & weather features.
4. **Model Training** – Using machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Decision Tree, etc.).
5. **Prediction** – Accepting user inputs and predicting AQI + category.
6. **Visualization** – Graphs for AQI distribution and trends.
